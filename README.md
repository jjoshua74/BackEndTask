Unit tests:
# Units tests are also something new to me. For some reason the 'from .models import Article' doesn't work in this file.
# I can't figure out what is causing the import error - so this file does not run. I have added a few examples of
# how I would have attempted to run unit tests. I did not add unit tests for the whole project, since the file does
# not actually work and trying to fix the import error has delayed me to the point where I don't think I will submit on
# time if I still try to finish all unit tests.

# sorry
