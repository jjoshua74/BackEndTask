Back End Task
The task is to build a RESTful JSON API using Django for a simple blog. As
you will be building an API, there is no requirement for any front-end
templates or pages.
This task might take longer than the allowed time to complete. With this
in mind, please work with an incremental approach, so that if you run out
of time, you have completed some parts of the task.
The API should have the ability to list and retrieve articles, with their
title, content, created date, last modified date and author.
The API should also have the ability to add and delete articles, which are
only accessible to admin users. APIs for adding and managing admin
users are not necessary, as these can be done with Djangoâ€™s admin tools.
Articles should have comments, which anyone can add, list and retrieve
using a separate API endpoint.
Only admin users should be able to delete comments.
Comments should contain their content as well as a name for the user,
unless the user is an admin, where the name can be derived from the
admin user record.

If there is any remaining time, please add appropriate unit tests.
Please use git for source control, and make your code available online
through GitHub, Gitlab, or Bitbucket.
